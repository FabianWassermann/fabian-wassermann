A solution if you need to develop WPF with Visual Studio but you are working on a Mac-Silicon.

## What is WPF?

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), a UI framework that is resolution-independent and uses a vector-based rendering engine, built to take advantage of modern graphics hardware.
It's basically one way of creating an windows UI-Application with C#.

## The problem

The brainer would say: "Setup a Windows-VM and install a Visual Studio and you are ready to go".
And he's right for Intel-Macs but in case you are using a Mac-Silicon you simply can't do it that way.
Currently, there is no VM which can translate fast to arm-processors and thats the problem in this case.

## Solution 1

In order to use this solution you need to have an Azure-Account or an account of an other hosting provider.
If you are attending school you may have 100USD or more per year of free credits, otherwise you have to pay every hour of developing yourself.

### Step 1: Azure Visual Studio

<Image src={azureVisualStudioSearch} alt="" />

Search for "Visual Studio" and click on the Visual Studio version you want to use.

Then select the Community version if you don't have access to a higher tier.

In the following you need to enter settings for your Server.
The most important setting is to allow inbound port for RDP so that you can connect.

Finally start the server.

### Step 2: Install remote desktop app

In order to connect and view your server you can use a remote desktop application, which can be downloaded from AppStore.
My personal preference is the Microsoft Remote Desktop app.

Click on create PC, enter the IP of your server and click on add.
Congrats, you connected to your cloud server and you'r ready to work with the preinstalled Visual Studio.

## Solution 2

In case you own an old windows machine you can use it as a server by running it in your home network and exposing it to the web.
You can access your own windows machine in the same way as the Azure-Server.
