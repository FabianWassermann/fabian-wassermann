## Why Build a B2B SaaS for Austrian Tax Advisors? (Capital Gains Tax Automation Explained)

My original idea was quite simple:
I wanted a tool—essentially a “digital tax consultant”—that could handle Austrian capital gains tax (KESt) calculations
for my stock trades with foreign brokers.
I reached out to an established tax consulting firm, hoping they could take care of this for me.
To my surprise, they told me **they weren't able to support this specific use case**, despite not being a small firm by any means.

A few weeks later, something unexpected happened.
**A tax advisory firm from Vienna contacted me**, inquiring about my KestAustria software.
Up to that point, I had only built a B2C SaaS for fun—something for private investors like myself.
But this new client had a different scenario in mind: **they wanted to import and automatically process
data for multiple clients within a B2B SaaS**.

In the following article I will share why and how this Saas can benefit tax consulting firms.

## The Pain Points for Tax Advisors: Where Existing Tools Fall Short

Most established software solutions, such as [BMD](https://www.bmd.com/at/) and [DATEV](https://datev.at/kanzlei/), are excellent at accounting and form submission—but **they assume the values for each tax form (like Austria's E1kv) are already prepared**.

Yet, for international stock trading accounts, preparing these values means that the advisor must:

- Import and standardize broker transaction statements (from disparate banks and platforms)
- Correctly classify each transaction (buy, sell, dividend, etc.)
- Apply Austrian capital gains tax rules, tax year cutoffs, reporting currencies, and specific exemptions
- Track losses, offsets, and double-taxation treaties by transaction
- Aggregate all results _per client_, ready for automated transfer into the E1kv

In practice, this is **error-prone and extremely time-consuming**—even with Excel macros or partial import tools.

## My B2B SaaS was built to automate these core challenges:

- **Bulk process** raw broker exports for all clients in a secure, centralized web dashboard
- Run intelligent parsing and tax calculation logic for **hundreds or thousands of transactions**
- **Instantly generate** the E1kv-ready summaries for each client and reporting year
- Support complex portfolios with foreign currencies, changing tax law, and multi-asset classes
- Handle both Reporting Funds and Non-Reporting Funds with ÖKB integration

The result? Firms can handle **many more clients** (with less manual work), **reduce mistakes**, and offer a **faster, more professional digital service**.
