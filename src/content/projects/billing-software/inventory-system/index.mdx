## The idea

My client wants to track all his spare parts in his warehouse and truck.
He wants to manage all his spare parts including moving parts from the
warehouse to the truck. In the future he wants to consume parts by invoices so that the
stock level changes automatically if he used parts.

## First steps

First of all we need a new page for the inventory system.

<Image src={page} alt="" />

My toughts about what the user wants to do:

- see stock levels
- see history of bookings
- create bookings

## Feature 1: Set initial stock level

Initially my client needs to set the initial stock level of each part.

<Image src={setInitialStock} alt="" />

This would add **1 part** with the number **202458E** to the **warehouse**.

## Feature 2: Stock level list

An overview over the parts of a stock location with select option for actions.

<div className="relative">
  <Image src={stockLevelList} alt="" />
  <Image
    src={stockLevelListActions}
    alt=""
    className="absolute right-0 bottom-0 mb-5 shadow ring-1 ring-gray-300"
  />
</div>

## Feature 3: Change stock level

If my client made a mistake counting the parts and needs to change a stock level he can easily to this.

By clicking on the "Lagerstand anpassen" button, the stock level can be changed to any value.

## Feature 4: Change stock spot

My client organizes all parts in boxes on shelfs and he wants to track where which part is located.

By clicking on the "Ort anpassen" button, the stock spot can be changed.

<Image src={stockSpotModal} alt="" />

## Feature 5: Booking history

My client can view the entire booking history of a stock location like the warehouse or the truck.
Each booking holds information about the type, parts, related stock locations and date.

<Image src={bookingHistory} alt="" />

## Feature 6: Part page

The user can click on a part row in the table and opens an overview page showing more details about this one part.

The overview shows how many parts are in all stock locations and all bookings related to this part.

<Image src={partOverview} alt="" />

## Feature 7: Bring parts from warehouse to truck

The user can click on "Aktionen" > "Umladen" and can select all parts he wants to transfer to the truck or back to the warehouse.

## Feature 8: Part management

Some parts are not in our system because we only imported some parts of the mulag online shop.
But my client wants to add more parts to the system, so I created a part manager.

<Image src={partManagement} alt="" className="max-w-lg" />

The user can create an update parts.
There are different types because mulag articles need to sync prices with the mulag shop.

<Image src={createPart} alt="" className="max-w-lg" />

Thats not everything for this update and more features are in development.
Thank you for reading this software update!
